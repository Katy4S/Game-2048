2048 Game


The 2048 game is a sliding tile puzzle where players use arrow keys to combine tiles with the same numbers, aiming to reach the coveted 2048 tile. The game board is a 4x4 grid and supports the following functionalities:

* Game Mechanics:
    * Slide tiles in four directions (left, right, up, down).
    * Merge two tiles of equal value to create a tile with double the number.
    * New tiles (2 or 4, with a 10% probability for 4) appear after every move.
    * Increase score based on the sum of merged tiles.
    * Detect win (when a tile with 2048 is created) and game over (when no moves are possible).

Features
* Responsive Game Board: A dynamic 4x4 grid that adapts to different screen sizes.
* Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys to navigate and merge tiles.
* Score Tracking: Real-time score updates as you merge tiles.
* Game Status: Visual indicators for game start, win, and game over.
* Customizable Design: Extend and modify the provided HTML/CSS to suit your preferences.
* Smooth Gameplay: Optional animations for a more engaging experience.
